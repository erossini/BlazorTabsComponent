## How to use
First, add the NuGet package in your project. The name of the package is PSC.Blazor.Components.Tabs and the only dependency it has is Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web (>= 5.0.10).

After that, in your wwwroot\index.html or in the hosts file, you have to add a theme (CSS) for your segment control. Obviously, you can create your own theme. So, use this code:

```
<link href="_content/PSC.Blazor.Components.Tabs/themes/{theme-name}.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
